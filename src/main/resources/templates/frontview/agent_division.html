						<p>Zunshayn Apparels is eager to represent your company and
							purchasing interests in Asia, and to become an integral part of
							your organization. Our wide array of services ranges from
							standard inspections to assistance in buying and sourcing and
							even with the implementation of a Code of Conduct such as the
							BSCI.</p>
						<p>For each client, a tailor-made service is designed to best
							fit their needs, which can easily be adopted within the
							client&#39;s own organization.</p>

						<h4 class="text-warning">Services:</h4>
						<ul class="list-unstyled">

							<li>2. Inspection</li>
							<li>3. Documentation&#47;Shipping</li>
							<li>4. Sampling&#47;Collection</li>
							<li>5. Consultancy</li>
						</ul>

						<h4 class="text-warning">Sourcing&#47;purchasing</h4>
						<p>Benefiting from European management skills and our
							knowledge of the European and Asian markets, the vital new
							developments in each market are signaled and immediately informed
							to and discussed with our client. Our clients will experience the
							significant added value we provide through this service.</p>
						<p>We actively source for new fabric and other possibilities,
							including new factories. We currently already work with a wide
							range of factories, each with its own strength and weaknesses.</p>
						<h4 class="text-warning">Inspection</h4>
						<p> Monitoring the production process requires an on-the-spot presence to reduce the risk of substandard quality, and to ensure that all other aspects of contractual obligations are met. The earlier those possible execution shortcomings are detected the better, in order to initiate timely corrective action. </p>
						<ul class="list-unstyled">

							<li>2. Pre&#8209;production inspection</li>
							<li>3. Inline inspection</li>
							<li>4. Final &#40;pre&#8209;shipment&#41; inspection</li>
						</ul>
						<h4 class="text-warning">Quality Standards </h4>
						<p>For all our inspections we use the internationally recognized Acceptable Quality Level (AQL) standards. For each Inspection, this allows the client to set their acceptable quality tolerance levels. </p>
						
						<h4 class="text-warning">Acceptable Quality Level (AQL)</h4>
						<p>The Acceptable Quality Level, commonly referred to as AQL, is a method widely used to measure a production order sample to determine whether the order as a whole has met the clientï¿½s quality standards and specifications. The client then has the data to make an informed decision to accept or reject the consignment.</p>
						
						<h4 class="text-warning">Documentation&#47;Shipping</h4>
						<p>We ensure that all your shipping instructions are carried out correctly and that all documents comply with the export and import regulations of concerned countries.</p>
						<p>This service guarantees that the finished and packaged goods meet your specifications &#40;product type and quantity&#41; and are securely loaded for shipment. </p>
						<h4 class="text-warning">Sampling&#47;Collection</h4>
						<p>We are able to support your styling team in creating and arranging all kind of materials and accessories, in order to produce a collection for sales purposes. </p>
						<p>We treat all our client collection strict confidential and will protect them against any third parties.</p>
						
						<h4 class="text-warning">Collection&#47; developments </h4>
						<p>Every season we provide and create our own collection on which our clients can directly add their orders or even make alterations on the specific styles/development to match their requirements.</p>
						<p>To maintain integrity we are very strict that our developments will not create any competition between different parties.</p>
						<p>If you are interested to see a part of the running collections, please feel free to contact us.</p>
						<h4 class="text-warning">Consultancy</h4>
						<p>We assist and advise our client in developing and
							implementing effective social standards such as, for example, the
							BSCI.</p>
